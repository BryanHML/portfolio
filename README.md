## Work Experience
**Teaching Associate (Peer Assisted Study Sessions) @ Monash University (_Nov 2024 - Nov 2025_)**
- Led 4 weekly PASS sessions for 170+ students in FIT9136, strengthening understanding of Python programming and foundational algorithm design (FIT9136).
- Designed and delivered 24+ structured lesson plans with collaborative exercises focused on recursion, debugging, and problem-solving strategies.
- Introduced an innovative shared-laptop coding method that increased engagement, enabled peer-teaching, and improved collective debugging efficiency.
- Cultivated an inclusive learning environment that contributed to 76.4% of students achieving a Distinction or High Distinction.

**Research Assistant (Monash Robotics under Chenyuan Zhang) @ Monash University (_Nov 2024 - Feb 2025_)**
- Replicated the Behaviour Cloning (BC) model, achieving 60% action-prediction accuracy in Cramped Room of Overcooked.
- Built a multi-layout BC model with performance up to 58.3% accuracy across five environments in Overcooked.
- Identified severe dataset imbalance, with the “Stay” action dominating 58.1% - 73.9% of human-human trajectories.
- Developed a custom Python metrics script to compute layout-wise accuracy, macro accuracy, F1-scores, and confusion matrices for model evaluation.

## Projects
### LinkedWise – AI-Powered STEM Career Guidance Platform (Monash University Capstone Project)
[Website](https://linkedwise-web.onrender.com/)

- Developed AI-driven features including resume summarisation, skill-gap detection, and personalised career recommendations using Google Gemini, NLP techniques, and structured data modelling.
- Designed and engineered the data architecture, implementing a secure PostgreSQL/AWS RDS backend, RIASEC psychometric scoring logic, and end-to-end data pipelines for AI processing, storage, and retrieval.
- Applied strong ethical and legal frameworks (Australian Privacy Act, ACS Code of Conduct) by implementing privacy-safe resume handling, minimising personal data retention, and evaluating AI outputs for fairness and transparency.
